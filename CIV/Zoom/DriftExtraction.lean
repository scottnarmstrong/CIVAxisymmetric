# Extracting an admissible drift from a sequence of drifts

Generic in the ambient dimension `m` and the time horizon `T`: given a sequence of drifts
`(b n, divb n)` that are, eventually in `n`, bounded and Lipschitz in space on every compact
time-window `J ⊆ Iic T` (deviation D14 in `docs/DEVIATIONS.md`), this file
extracts a subsequence along which `(b, divb)` converges, in the sense required by
`CIV.IsAdmissibleDrift`, to an admissible drift `(B, divB)` on `Iio T`.

The route avoids weak-* (Banach-Alaoglu) compactness, which the hypotheses do not support in
general (a bounded, equi-Lipschitz-in-space sequence such as `b n (x, τ) = sin (n τ)` need not
have any pointwise- or weak-*-convergent subsequence in time). Instead it uses:

* time-`T`-clamped primitives `z ↦ ∫ s in (T - 1)..(min z.2 T), φ i n (z.1, s)`, built from each
  scalar component of `(b, divb)`, which inherit a *joint* space-time Lipschitz bound from the
  space-Lipschitz bound on `(b, divb)`;
* a box-diagonal chaining of the classical (Arzelà-Ascoli) compactness theorem to extract one
  subsequence along which every primitive converges, locally uniformly, to a continuous limit;
* a from-scratch real-analysis lemma (`exists_measurable_ae_hasDerivAt_of_lipschitz_mixed`)
  recovering a Borel, a.e.-Lipschitz-and-bounded classical time-derivative of each limit from
  its joint Lipschitz structure, via a countable dense set, absolute continuity, the McShane
  extension of a Lipschitz function, and a limsup/liminf sandwich of difference quotients;
* `CIV.ae_weakDiv_of_tendstoUniformlyOn_primitive` and
  `CIV.tendsto_integral_mul_of_tendstoUniformlyOn_primitive` (`CIV/Zoom/DriftLimitPassage.lean`),
  which pass the finite-`n` weak-divergence identity and the weak-convergence conclusion to the
  limit along the same subsequence.

The oscillatory example above is fine on this route: `a_n → 0` uniformly and the limit drift is
`0`, matching the conclusion of `CIV.exists_subseq_admissibleDrift` below.

/-! ### From a mixed Lipschitz bound on a primitive to its a.e.-Lipschitz time-derivative -/

/-- Given `F : Vec m × ℝ → ℝ`, continuous, such that on every compact time-window `Icc c d`
there is one constant `Λ` bounding both the time-Lipschitz constant of `F(x, ·)` (each `x`) and
the "mixed" Lipschitz constant of its increments over `[τ, τ']` as a function of `x` — the
structure enjoyed by the time-primitive of a field that is bounded and Lipschitz in space,
uniformly in time on `Icc c d` — the classical (limsup-of-difference-quotients) time-derivative
`G` of `F` is Borel measurable, and for a.e. `τ` in every compact time-window it is, at every
`x`, the genuine derivative of `F(x, ·)`, again bounded and Lipschitz in `x` with the same `Λ`. -/
