# The cutoff adapter: globally smooth fields agreeing with the zoom slices on growing squares

`CIV.step_finite_contradiction` (`FiniteContradictionClosure.lean`) asks for a sequence of
meridional fields `Vseq`, `Wseq : ℕ → ℝ × ℝ → ℝ` that is `ContDiff ℝ (⊤ : ℕ∞)` on **all** of `ℝ × ℝ`
for **every** `n`. The actual finite-axis zoom fields `zoomV (lam n) h (zc n) u (·, -1)`,
`zoomW (lam n) h (zc n) u (·, -1)` are smooth only on the preimage of `unitCylinder` under the
zoom map at scale `lam n`, a bounded region whose size grows without bound only as
`lam n → 0` (no *single* positive scale covers an unbounded region). This file builds the repair: for each `n`, a smooth cutoff supported strictly inside
that preimage, equal to `1` on a square that grows without bound as `lam n → 0`, whose product
with the zoom slice is globally smooth (`ContDiff ℝ (⊤ : ℕ∞)` on the *whole* plane, for every `n`,
not merely eventually) because the product is identically zero on a neighbourhood of every
point outside the cutoff's support, regardless of how the raw slice behaves there.

The zoom centre is a sequence `zc : ℕ → ℝ`, one axial offset per stage, uniformly bounded by a
single `ζ < 1`: the paper zooms about the moving pair `(0, z_n)`, so a single fixed centre
cannot be fed the selected data of `CIV.exists_seq_three_terms_dichotomy`, whose third output
is itself a sequence of heights.

The cutoff is a plain Mathlib `ContDiffBump` centred at the origin of `ℝ × ℝ`, which carries
the sup norm (`Prod.norm_def`) — the same norm `CIV.halfPlaneRectangle`'s squares use — so no
Euclidean/sup conversion factor is needed anywhere in this file.

/-! ### The safe radius: an explicit sup-square inside the preimage of `unitCylinder` -/

/-- If a square of sup-radius `r` around the origin satisfies `lam ^ (1 - 2h) * r ≤ (1 - |zc|)
/ 2`, every point of that square zooms, at the frozen time `τ = -1`, into `unitCylinder`. The
margin `(1 - |zc|) / 2` is what is left over from the standing bound `|zc| < 1` after the
meridional radius and the axial offset are each kept below it; the algebra is the same
splitting used in `CIV.eventually_zoomPoint_mem_unitCylinder`, specialised to an explicit
radius instead of an asymptotic filter. -/

/-! ### A bump-multiplied local field is globally smooth -/

/-- A bump function whose closed outer ball lies inside an open set on which `g` is smooth
gives a globally smooth product. At a point of the open set both factors are smooth there; at
a point outside the bump's outer ball the product is identically zero on a neighbourhood
(because the bump itself is, `ContDiffBump.zero_of_le_dist`), regardless of `g`'s behaviour
there — `g` need not even be continuous outside the open set. -/

`(1 - |zc n|) / (2 lam ^ (1 - 2h))` is exactly the radius at which
`zoomPoint_mem_unitCylinder_of_norm_le` certifies safety, so its closed outer ball lies inside
the preimage of `unitCylinder`; its inner radius is half of that, so it equals `1` on the
sup-square of that half-radius. -/

/-- As the scale `lam` tends to `0` the cutoff's inner radius grows without bound, uniformly
over the stage `n`: for every target square radius `r`, eventually (for `lam n` small) the
inner radius at stage `n` exceeds `r`, so the cutoff equals `1` throughout that square
(`ContDiffBump.eventuallyEq_one_of_mem_ball` gives it pointwise; the radius bound gives every
point of the square membership in that inner ball). Only the shared bound `ζ` on `|zc n|` is
used, so the bound is uniform over the whole moving sequence at once. -/
