# The comparison principle applied to the two ancient limits of `prop:aniso:small`

The last step of each branch of the zoom argument of `prop:aniso:small` applies the last
assertion of `lem:aniso:comparison` to the limiting scalar:

* in the finite-axis case, to the lifted limit `Ω_∞(X, Z, τ) = Ω(|X|, Z, τ)` of the rescaled
  potential vorticities on `ℝ⁴ × ℝ × (-∞, -1)`, with `(m, d) = (5, 4)` and `κ = 3/2 + h`
  (the paragraph after `eq:aniso:zoom:finite:limit`);
* in the receding-axis case, to the limit `Θ` of the rescaled azimuthal vorticities on
  `ℝ² × (-∞, -1)`, with `(m, d) = (2, 1)` and `κ = 1 + h` (the paragraph after
  `eq:aniso:zoom:receding:limit`).

In both cases the limit is continuous on the relevant open set up to the endpoint `τ = -1`
(it is a locally uniform limit) and obeys the decay bound inherited from
`eq:aniso:zoom:finite:bound` or `eq:aniso:zoom:receding:bound`. The two theorems below take
exactly these facts, together with the admissible drift and the distributional limit equation,
and conclude that the limit vanishes at every point of `{τ = -1}` (off the axis in the
finite-axis case). The local boundedness, the measurability and the decay premise of the
comparison lemma are derived here from the continuity and the pointwise bound; the axis
`{X = 0}` of the lifted variables is a null set.
