# The comparison assertions from the transfer of essential bounds

This file reduces both assertions of `lem:aniso:comparison`, the statements `CIV.comparison` and
`CIV.comparisonAncient`, to one transfer property of essential bounds forward in time: for a.e.
reference time `τ₀` and a.e. later time `τ`, every essential bound `M` of `q (·, τ₀)` is an
essential bound of `q (·, τ)`. This is the hypothesis `hstep`, in the binder shape of
`comparison_eLpNorm_top_of_ae_dominance`, which converts it into the `eLpNorm ⊤` conclusion. Both
theorems below take every hypothesis of the corresponding statement, plus `hstep`, and have
exactly its conclusion.

The transfer property itself is proved from the hypotheses of the comparison lemma by
`CIV.ae_ae_abs_le_of_isDistributionalDriftDiffusion`; `CIV.Main.comparisonAncient` combines it
with `comparisonAncient_of_eLpNorm_transfer`. Every function constant in time satisfies `hstep`
(`hstep_of_forall_eq_of_time_indep`).

The hypotheses `hd`, `hI`, `hB` and `heq` of `comparison_of_eLpNorm_transfer` are not used by its
proof, which goes through `hq` and `hstep` alone; they are kept, under their ordinary names, so
that its hypotheses are those of the statement.

/-- **`hstep` is satisfiable.** Any function constant in the time variable satisfies the
transfer hypothesis `hstep` of `comparison_of_eLpNorm_transfer`: the bounding condition at a
reference time `τ₀` and at a later time `τ` are then literally the same statement, since
`q (·, τ)` and `q (·, τ₀)` agree pointwise for every `x`. In particular every steady state
satisfies `hstep`. -/

/-- **`comparison`, from the transfer of essential bounds.** Every hypothesis of the statement
`CIV.comparison` is carried unchanged; the one addition is `hstep`, the transfer hypothesis of
`comparison_eLpNorm_top_of_ae_dominance`, in that lemma's binder shape. The conclusion is that of
`CIV.comparison`.

`hd`, `hI`, `hB` and `heq` are not used by this derivation, which goes through `hq` and `hstep`
alone: given `hstep`, `comparison_eLpNorm_top_of_ae_dominance` supplies the `eLpNorm ⊤`
reformulation, and nothing further is needed from the drift or distributional hypotheses. The
transfer property `hstep` follows from `hI`, `hB`, `hq` and `heq` by
`CIV.ae_ae_abs_le_of_isDistributionalDriftDiffusion`. -/

/-- **`comparisonAncient`, from the transfer of essential bounds.** Every hypothesis of the
statement `CIV.comparisonAncient` is carried unchanged; the one addition is `hstep`, in the same
shape as `comparison_of_eLpNorm_transfer` above, instantiated at `I := Iio T`. The conclusion is
that of `CIV.comparisonAncient`.

The proof composes three lemmas. `comparison_of_eLpNorm_transfer` supplies, from `hstep`, exactly
the comparison-monotonicity hypothesis `ancientVanishing_ae_eq_zero` needs.
`ancientVanishing_ae_eq_zero` then proves the first conjunct from that and the decay hypothesis
`hdecay`. `ancientVanishing_continuousOn_eq_zero` proves the second conjunct from the first; it is
stated over `V`, `q'`, openness, continuity and the a.e. agreement in the shape of the
statement. -/
