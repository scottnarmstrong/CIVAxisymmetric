# The distributional fundamental theorem of calculus, and the comparison energy inequality

`CIV.Comparison.EnergyInequality` proves the two easy pieces of the Grönwall step of
`lem:aniso:comparison` — the support/integrability facts about `comparisonEnergy` and the
integral-form Grönwall inequality itself — with the integrated energy inequality
`eq:aniso:comparison:positive:energy` as a hypothesis (`hineq` of
`comparisonEnergy_le_exp_mul_integral_sq`). That integrated inequality is obtained from the
mollified equation `eq:aniso:comparison:mollified` (`mollified_equation`) in three stages:
(1) upgrading the time-tested identity `mollified_equation` delivers into the
fundamental-theorem-of-calculus statement that the mollified slice *is* the primitive of the right
side of `eq:aniso:comparison:mollified`; (2) a Green identity and energy computation testing that
identity against `(q_ε - Ψ_σ)_+`, which is only Lipschitz; (3) passing to the limit in a
regularization parameter. This module proves stage (1) completely, in the generality needed to feed
`mollified_equation`'s exact conclusion shape.

## Main result

`eq_add_intervalIntegral_of_pairing_eq`: if `f` is continuous on an open, order connected `I`,
`h` is locally integrable on `I`, and `f` obeys the tested identity `∫ f (-χ') = ∫ χ h` for every
`χ` that is `ContDiff ℝ (⊤ : ℕ∞)`, compactly supported, with support in `I` — the shape
`mollified_equation` delivers with `f τ = q_ε(x, τ)` and `h` the right side of
`eq:aniso:comparison:mollified` at a fixed `x` — then `f` is literally the primitive of `h`:
`f τ = f τ₀ + ∫ s in τ₀..τ, h s` for every `τ₀, τ ∈ I`.

The proof decomposes an arbitrary smooth compactly supported test function `ρ` against a fixed
reference bump `β` (`∫ β = 1`, built from `ContDiffBump`) into a mean-zero part and a multiple of
`β`. The mean-zero part is the negative derivative of a compactly supported primitive
(`exists_contDiff_hasCompactSupport_deriv_eq_neg_of_integral_eq_zero`), so the hypothesis applies
to it directly; the primitive `F` of `h` obeys the same tested identity against that same `χ`
(`integral_primitive_mul_deriv_eq_integral_mul_of_isOpen`), proved through the integration by parts
already in Mathlib for `AbsolutelyContinuousOnInterval` functions together with the interval form
of the Lebesgue differentiation theorem (`IntervalIntegrable.ae_hasDerivAt_integral`) — not a hand
Fubini argument. Comparing the two identities and testing again against `β` pins `f - F` to a
constant on `I` via `ae_eq_zero_of_integral_contDiff_smul_eq_zero`, and evaluating at `τ₀` shows
that constant is `0`.

## Use

`eq_add_intervalIntegral_of_pairing_eq` is applied to `mollified_equation` in
`CIV.mollifySlice_eq_add_intervalIntegral`, which takes continuity in time of the mollified slice
and local integrability of the mollified right side as explicit hypotheses.
`CIV.ae_ae_sub_eq_intervalIntegral_of_pairing_eq` is the almost-everywhere version without the
continuity hypothesis; it gives `CIV.mollifySlice_ae_ae_sub_eq_intervalIntegral` from the
hypotheses of the comparison lemma alone.

For stages (2)-(3), note that the natural closed form for the Kato regularization,
`Φ_κ(g) = (g + √(g² + κ²)) / 2 − κ/2`, does **not** tend to `0` as `g → -∞`: it tends to `-κ/2`.
Once `v_ε = (q_ε - Ψ_σ)_+` is compactly supported and `Φ_κ` is applied to `q_ε - Ψ_σ` directly
(which is unbounded below away from the support of `v_ε`), the energy `∫ Φ_κ(q_ε - Ψ_σ)²` over all
of `Vec m` is **not finite** for a fixed `κ > 0`, since the integrand tends to the nonzero constant
`κ²/4` at spatial infinity while `Vec m` has infinite measure. `CIV.Comparison.EnergyInequality3`
therefore applies a `κ`-independent spatial truncation (`CIV.mollifierCutoff`) before the Kato
step.

/-- The distributional fundamental theorem of calculus: if `f` is continuous on an open, order
connected `I`, `h` is locally integrable on `I`, and `f` obeys the tested identity
`∫ f (-χ') = ∫ χ h` for every smooth compactly supported `χ` with support in `I` (the shape
`mollified_equation` delivers), then `f` is literally the primitive of `h` based at any
`τ₀ ∈ I`, throughout `I`. -/
