# Hausdorff measure, Lipschitz maps, and null sets

When a subset of `ℝ³` has vanishing one-dimensional Hausdorff measure, its Lipschitz
image has vanishing Lebesgue measure (`volume_image_eq_zero_of_hausdorffMeasure_one_eq_zero`),
and consequently almost every radius `r` avoids the image (`ae_notMem_image_of_hausdorffMeasure_one_eq_zero`).
The classical fact that a null set cannot contain a whole sphere for almost every radius,
used in the proof of `lem:aniso:annulus`, is `ae_forall_norm_ne_of_hausdorffMeasure_one_eq_zero`:
for a null set `S`, almost every `r` has `∂B(r) ∩ S = ∅`.

by more than the Lipschitz constant: `μH¹(f '' S) ≤ K · μH¹(S)`. -/

/-! ### Spheres avoiding a null set -/

/-- For a subset `S` of `ℝ³` with vanishing one-dimensional Hausdorff measure, almost every
radius `r` has the property that no point of `S` lies on the sphere `‖x‖ = r`. This is the
classical fact behind the choice of a radius `R` with `∂B(R)` disjoint from the singular set
`S₀` in the proof of `lem:aniso:annulus`. -/
