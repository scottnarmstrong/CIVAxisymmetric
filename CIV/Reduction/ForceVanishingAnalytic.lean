# Transfer of the analyticity bound along agreement on the unit cylinder

`AnalyticBoundOn` and `ForceSpatiallyAnalytic` read only spatial derivatives at points of
`B(1) × (-1, 0)`, and each such derivative is determined by the field on a spatial
neighbourhood inside that cylinder. So the analyticity bound `eq:analytic:interior:force`,
and with it `eq:interior:force:analytic`, transfers between two fields that merely agree on
the unit cylinder.

The consequence used by `cor:interior:nonanalytic` is the last theorem below: a force that
vanishes identically on the unit cylinder agrees there with the zero field, which satisfies
`eq:interior:force:analytic` by `forceSpatiallyAnalytic_const`. Contrapositively, a force
that violates `eq:interior:force:analytic` is somewhere nonzero on the unit cylinder, which
is the corollary's step from its first conclusion to its second, `f ≢ 0`.

/-- Two scalar fields agreeing on the unit cylinder have equal multi-index spatial partial
derivatives at every point of the unit cylinder: each of the three iterated directional
derivatives is taken at fixed time inside the open ball `B(1)`. -/
