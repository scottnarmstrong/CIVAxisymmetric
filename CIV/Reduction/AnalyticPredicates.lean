# The two spatial-analyticity predicates

`eq:interior:force:analytic` and `eq:analytic:interior:force` state the same locally uniform
spatial analyticity bound, once for the force on the unit cylinder and once for a general
field on `B(R) × (t₁, t₂)`. This module records the identity of the two readings at the unit
cylinder, and the restriction step that turns a single analyticity bound on a closed time
interval into the locally uniform statement, by monotonicity in the ball and in the interval.

The companion restriction on the other side of `lem:analytic:slice` is
`IsClassicalSolutionOn.mono`: being a classical solution is inherited by every subset of the
space-time set on which it holds, so the hypothesis may be read on the smaller cylinder the
analyticity statement is applied to.

/-- Spatial analyticity of the force on the unit cylinder, `eq:interior:force:analytic`, is
the locally uniform analyticity of `eq:analytic:interior:force` at `R = 1` on the time
interval `(-1, 0)`: the two definitions unfold to the same proposition. -/

/-- One analyticity bound on `B(R') × [t₁, t₂]` already gives the locally uniform statement on
`B(R') × (t₁, t₂)`: every smaller ball and every compactly contained closed time interval
inherit the same constants `M`, `a`. This is the restriction step owed by `lem:analytic:slice`
away from `R = 1`. -/

/-- Being a classical solution of `eq:nse:forced` is inherited by subsets: the smoothness of
the three fields restricts by `ContDiffOn.mono`, and the momentum and divergence equations
are pointwise conditions, so they hold at every point of the smaller set. -/
