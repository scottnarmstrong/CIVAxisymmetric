# `C¹` extraction on the whole plane

The recentred variables `eq:aniso:zoom:receding:variables` put the selected point at the origin
of `ℝ × ℝ` and send the axis to `R = -A_n` with `A_n → ∞`, so the meridional fields of the
receding-axis case live on the *whole* plane and the compact sets that exhaust their domain are
the centred squares `[-(j+1), j+1]²` rather than the half-plane squares of
`CIV.halfPlaneRectangle`.

A sequence of smooth functions on `ℝ × ℝ` whose values, gradients and second derivatives are
bounded by one constant `L` on each centred square — for all large `n`, the threshold being
allowed to depend on the square — has a subsequence converging, together with its gradient,
uniformly on every one of those squares.  The limit is bounded by `L` on all of `ℝ × ℝ` and is
differentiable at *every* point, since every point of the plane is interior to a centred square;
this is the difference with the half-plane statement, where the axis is a boundary and the
derivative is identified only off it.

The extraction on one square is `CIV.exists_subseq_tendstoUniformlyOn_c1`; the passage from one
square to all of them at once is the diagonal extraction
`CIV.exists_subseq_tendstoUniformlyOn_forall_of_subseq`, applied to the pair `(V_n, ∇V_n)` so
that the function and its gradient are extracted along a single subsequence.

The whole statement is at a fixed value of any remaining parameter: no time variable occurs, and
no equicontinuity in a parameter is claimed or used.

/-- `C¹` compactness on the plane: from a sequence of smooth functions whose value, gradient and
second derivative are bounded by `L` on each centred square for all large `n`, one subsequence
converges together with its gradient, uniformly on every centred square.  The limit obeys the
same bound everywhere, its gradient limit is continuous on each square, and the limit is
differentiable at every point with derivative the limit of the gradients. -/
